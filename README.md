## Questions 


1 What do you love most about computing?

The limitless potential of computing to create, connect, and solve problems is what I adore most about it. Through computing, we can create tools that improve people's lives, promote international cooperation, and open up completely new possibilities. The discipline is always changing and inspiring, whether it is by enabling new forms of human expression, developing elegant solutions to difficult problems, or investigating the limits of artificial intelligence and quantum computing.

Computing is also a fantastic equalizer, enabling people with ideas to scale their vision to a global audience with little to no financial investment. Computing is exciting because of its revolutionary potential to close gaps, advance society, and democratize opportunity.


2 If you could meet any scientist or engineer who died before A.D. 2000, whom would you choose, and why?

Alan Turing would be my choice if I could meet any engineer or scientist who lived before the year 2000. His significant contributions to artificial intelligence, cryptography, and computers established the groundwork for the current digital era.

Turing's contributions to the idea of the Turing Machine established the foundation of computer science and codified the fundamentals of computation. In addition to saving countless lives during World War II, his attempts to crack the Enigma code demonstrated the tremendous power of logic and mathematics when applied to practical issues.

It would be a rare chance to meet Turing and learn about his ideas for AI and computing. I would love to talk to him about his ideas on the ethical and societal ramifications of intelligent machines—topics that are still pertinent today—and how he saw the future of the field he pioneered.

Furthermore, Turing's fortitude in the face of social and personal adversity is incredibly motivating. His tale serves as a lesson of the value of tenacity, ingenuity, and remaining loyal to one's principles despite hardship.
